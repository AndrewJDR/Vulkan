## Broken Examples 

These examples are not functioning as intended yet.

### [Text overlay (Multi pass)](examples/broken/textoverlay.cpp)
<img src="./documentation/screenshots/textoverlay.png" height="96px" align="right">

Renders a 2D text overlay on top of an existing 3D scene. The example implements a text overlay class with separate descriptor sets, layouts, pipelines and render pass to detach it from the rendering of the scene. The font is generated by loading glyph data from a [stb font file](http://nothings.org/stb/font/) into a buffer that's copied to the font image.

After rendering the scene, the second render pass of the text overlay class loads the contents of the first render pass and displays text on top of it using blending.

### [Omnidirectional shadow mapping](examples/broken/shadowmappingomni.cpp)
<img src="./documentation/screenshots/shadow_omnidirectional.png" height="96px" align="right">

Uses a dynamic 32 bit floating point cube map for a point light source that casts shadows in all directions (unlike projective shadow mapping).
The cube map faces contain the distances from the light sources, which are then used in the scene rendering pass to determine if the fragment is shadowed or not.
